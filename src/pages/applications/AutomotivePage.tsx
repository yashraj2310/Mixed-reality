        title: "Design and Engineering",
        content: "Mixed Reality transforms automotive design by allowing designers and engineers to visualize and interact with full-scale virtual vehicle models. Design teams can walk around virtual prototypes, look inside engine compartments, and evaluate ergonomics without building physical mockups. This accelerates the design process, reduces costs, and enables more iterations before committing to production tooling. MR also facilitates collaboration between global design teams working on the same virtual models.",

        title: "Manufacturing and Assembly",
        content: "On the factory floor, Mixed Reality provides workers with step-by-step visual guidance for complex assembly tasks. Instructions appear directly in the worker's field of view, highlighting the correct components and assembly locations. This reduces errors, shortens training time, and improves quality. For quality control, MR applications can overlay design specifications onto physical components to quickly identify deviations or defects.",

        title: "Sales and Customer Experience",
        content: "Mixed Reality is transforming the car buying experience by allowing customers to visualize vehicles with different options and configurations before they're built. Shoppers can change colors, wheels, and interior options in real-time, or even place virtual vehicles in their own driveways to see how they look. For dealerships, this reduces the need to stock every possible configuration while providing customers with a more engaging and informative shopping experience.",

This allows drivers to access important information without looking away from the road. Future developments will likely include more immersive passenger entertainment experiences and enhanced visualization of vehicle surroundings for improved safety.",
